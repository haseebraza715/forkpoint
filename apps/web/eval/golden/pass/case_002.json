    "editor": "SUMMARY:\nYou keep revisiting a decision because you do not want to close off options.\nFIXES:\n- \"revisiting\": specify how often you return to it.\n- \"same choice\": name the decision to make it concrete.\n- \"close off options\": clarify which options feel costly to lose.\nREWRITE:\nI keep revisiting the same decision because I don't want to close off options.",
    "definer": "KEY TERMS:\n- \"revisiting\": reconsidering the same choice more than once after deciding.\n- \"close off options\": remove paths that cannot be reopened later.\nAMBIGUITIES:\n- \"same choice\": could be a single decision or a cluster of related decisions.\n- \"options\": could mean career options or short-term tactics.\nBOUNDARIES:\n- Not claiming: you lack enough information to decide.\n- Not claiming: any option is objectively bad.",
    "skeptic": "CORE CLAIM:\nYou delay committing because you want to keep options open.\nCHALLENGES:\n- \"revisiting\": this could be indecision caused by unclear criteria rather than attachment to options.\n- \"close off options\": you may be overestimating the permanence of the choice.\n- \"keep\": this could be procrastination framed as optionality, which changes the fix.\nTEST:\nWrite a one-sentence decision rule today and follow it for 7 days.",
    "coach": "INTENT:\nYou want to decide without losing important options (\"close off options\").\nOPTIONS:\n- Make the decision for 7 days, risking regret. Done looks like acting on one option for a week.\n- Define a reversible trial, risking ambiguity. Done looks like a fixed start/end date for the trial.\n- List the top two options and pick one by noon tomorrow, risking missed alternatives. Done looks like a written decision.\nRECOMMENDATION:\nPick the 7-day decision because it forces movement while keeping time-bounded reversibility. It closes the option of revisiting daily for the next week.\nFOR THE NEXT 7 DAYS, STOP:\n- Reopening the decision each day\n- Seeking new information about other options"
