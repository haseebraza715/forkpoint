    "editor": "SUMMARY:\nYou hesitate to finish a small project because you fear it will reveal you are less capable.\nFIXES:\n- \"keep hesitating\": specify the behavior (delaying starts, avoiding deadlines).\n- \"finish a small project\": name the project to make the scope concrete.\n- \"prove I'm not as good\": clarify what standard of \"good\" you mean.\nREWRITE:\nI keep hesitating to finish a small project because I worry completing it will reveal I'm less capable than I think.",
    "definer": "KEY TERMS:\n- \"hesitating\": delaying a decision to finish for more than a week after planning to do so.\n- \"small project\": a task expected to take one week or less to complete.\nAMBIGUITIES:\n- \"not as good\": could mean lower skill than peers or lower skill than your own standard.\n- \"keep\": could mean weekly or only occasionally.\nBOUNDARIES:\n- Not claiming: you are actually less capable.\n- Not claiming: the project is objectively difficult.",
    "skeptic": "CORE CLAIM:\nYou delay finishing because you fear the project will expose lower ability.\nCHALLENGES:\n- \"keep hesitating\": this could reflect unclear scope rather than fear, which changes the intervention.\n- \"small project\": if it is ill-defined, the delay may be due to missing requirements, not self-doubt.\n- \"prove I'm not as good\": you may be using fear as a story when the real issue is low priority.\nTEST:\nSet a 60-minute timer and complete a concrete deliverable for this project once this week.",
    "coach": "INTENT:\nYou want to finish the project without the fear of being exposed (\"prove I'm not as good\").\nOPTIONS:\n- Finish a single concrete deliverable in 7 days, risking a visible result. Done looks like one shipped artifact.\n- Decide to pause the project for 7 days, risking no progress. Done looks like no work on it for a week.\n- Cut the scope to a one-page version and ship it, risking incompleteness. Done looks like a published draft.\nRECOMMENDATION:\nChoose the cut-scope version because it forces completion without pretending the fear is gone. It closes the option of endless tweaking for the next 7 days.\nFOR THE NEXT 7 DAYS, STOP:\n- Renaming or reorganizing the project\n- Adding new requirements"
