    "definer": "KEY TERMS:\n- \"changing the plan\": switching to a new routine within a week.\n- \"stick with\": following the same routine for at least four weeks.\nAMBIGUITIES:\n- \"every week\": could mean weekly or whenever a session is missed.\n- \"plan\": could mean type of workout or schedule.\nBOUNDARIES:\n- Not claiming: one routine is best.\n- Not claiming: exercise is the only goal.",
    "skeptic": "CORE CLAIM:\nChanging routines weekly prevents you from building consistency.\nCHALLENGES:\n- \"keep changing\": the issue could be unrealistic time slots rather than routine type.\n- \"never stick\": you may be missing measurement of adherence.\n- \"one week\": short trials can be valid if used intentionally.\nTEST:\nFollow one routine for 7 days and log each session.",
    "coach": "INTENT:\nYou want a consistent exercise routine but keep changing direction.\nOPTIONS:\n- Commit to running three times this week. Done looks like three logged runs.\n- Commit to running three times this week. Done looks like three logged runs.\n- Commit to running three times this week. Done looks like three logged runs.\nRECOMMENDATION:\nChoose running for the next 7 days and ignore other options.\nFOR THE NEXT 7 DAYS, STOP:\n- Researching other exercise plans\n- Switching routines mid-week"
