    "editor": "SUMMARY:\nYou feel stuck between keeping options open and committing to one idea.\nFIXES:\n- \"stuck\": specify how this shows up in actions.\n- \"keeping my options open\": name the options involved.\n- \"committing\": clarify what commitment would look like.\nREWRITE:\nI'm stuck between keeping my options open and committing to a single idea.",
    "definer": "KEY TERMS:\n- \"options open\": continuing to consider multiple ideas without choosing one.\n- \"committing\": making a decision that reduces alternatives.\nAMBIGUITIES:\n- \"options\": could mean product ideas or career paths.\n- \"stuck\": could mean no progress or repeated switching.\nBOUNDARIES:\n- Not claiming: one idea is objectively best.\n- Not claiming: commitment is permanent.",
    "skeptic": "CORE CLAIM:\nYou are afraid of losing your identity as a creative person, so you avoid committing to one idea.\nCHALLENGES:\n- \"stuck between keeping my options open\": this could just be poor prioritization, not identity fear. That matters because the fix would be scheduling, not self-concept work.\n- \"committing to a single idea\": you might be underestimating the cost of switching because you haven't tested constraints. That matters because your conclusion about being stuck may be premature.\n- \"stuck\": this could be a preference for novelty rather than a problem. That matters because you may be pathologizing a valid style.\nTEST:\nDo one 2-hour block per day for 7 days on a single idea and log how you feel.",
    "coach": "INTENT:\nYou are struggling with the identity shift from explorer to executor.\nOPTIONS:\n- Commit to one idea for a week. Done looks like a finished draft.\n- Keep exploring but set a deadline. Done looks like a decision.\n- Choose the safest idea. Done looks like quick progress.\nRECOMMENDATION:\nAdopt the identity of a shipper and close off exploration for a week.\nFOR THE NEXT 7 DAYS, STOP:\n- Brainstorming new ideas\n- Reading about alternatives"
